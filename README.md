As Head of Data Services at the University of Oregon Libraries I lead a team that helps students and faculty find, manage, analyze and share research data. Sometimes I get to teach basic programming in R, Python, Excel, and Power BI.

I like to use presentations and papers an opportunities to learn new things, collaborate with others, or think through ideas. In "[The Cultural Meaning of Programming Languages](https://youtu.be/kCZRauYfqvg?feature=shared")" I talk about how gendered stereotypes about programming languages used to exclude people parallel similar dynamics in literary history. With colleagues I've written about reproducibility best practices in general and in Cinema Studies, done bibliometric data analysis and visualization for papers in public relations management, and published a data paper. 

In a previous life I earned a Ph.D. in English literature, where my research focused on modernist poetry and literary translation. I once had [a poem](https://web.archive.org/web/20200803085720/https:/psa.fcny.org/psa/poetry/poetry_in_motion/atlas/portland/blackberries/) published on Tri-Met busses in Portland, OR.
